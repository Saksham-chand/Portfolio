                    SIC and SIC/XE Assembler (Fully Functional)
                    Year: 2024</p>
                    <p>This project involves the development of an assembler for the SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) and SIC/XE 
                        architecture, which are used in computer architecture courses to teach assembly language and machine-level programming. 
                        The assembler translates assembly code into machine code that can be executed on the SIC or SIC/XE system.</p>
                    <p>
                        Key features of the project include:
                    </p>
                    <p>* Full Functionality: The assembler is capable of handling both SIC and SIC/XE instruction formats, 
                        supporting various operations such as loading,storing, and arithmetic operations.</p>
                    <p>
                        * Error Checking: It includes robust error handling for syntax errors, operand errors, and invalid instructions, 
                            ensuring smooth debugging and learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        * Symbol Table: The project maintains a symbol table for variable addresses and labels, allowing the assembler 
                            to manage memory addresses efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        * Support for Extended Operations (SIC/XE): The SIC/XE version includes additional instruction formats 
                            (e.g., the extended format) to allow more complex operations, such as floating-point arithmetic and larger memory 
                            address space.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            * Optimized Code Generation: The assembler generates efficient machine code, translating high-level assembly instructions 
                        into optimized machine instructions.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        This project demonstrates a strong understanding of assembly language programming, computer architecture, and the translation 
                    of high-level code into machine-readable formats. 
                    It serves as an essential tool for learning low-level computer systems programming.
